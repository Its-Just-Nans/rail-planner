# rail-planner

This project use the open data of SNCF. As the data is incomplete, the project is not fully functional. Also the project calculates the shortest path between two stations (based on the location and not the duration). The project is based on the Dijkstra algorithm.

Check [get_data.py](./get_data.py) to see how the data is retrieved.
